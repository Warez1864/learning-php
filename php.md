# PHP Notes

This is some of my PHP Notes, which will be usefull.

PHP's Data Types:

String: A string is a sequence of characters, like "My name is Warez"
   * A string can be any text inside quotes
   * A string can be used in single or double quotes
   * The simplest way to create a string is to use single quotes,
   but the double quotes are used to create relatively complex strings compared to single quotes


Simple string in PHP. Example:
```php
<?php
    var_dump('I am 15 years old');


Output:
String(17) "I am 15 years old"
?>
```



Integer: An integer data type is a non-decimal number, like 5
   * An integer must have at least one digit
   * An integer can not have a decimal point
   * An integer can be either positive or negative

```php
$age = 5;
```


Float: A float is a number with a decimal point, like 5.5
   * Float is also called double
   * A number with a decimal point is a real number

```php
